# SQLite Database Utility Script

This Python script provides a set of utility functions for working with SQLite databases. It encompasses functionalities related to data import from CSV, data validation, query logging, and analysis of repeatable queries. The script is designed to be used in scenarios where data needs to be imported into an SQLite database, validated for quality, and queries need to be logged and analyzed.

## Features

- **Database Connection:** `connect_sqlite` function establishes a connection to an SQLite database and returns the connection and cursor.

- **CSV Data Import:** `import_csv_to_sqlite` function imports data from a CSV file into an SQLite database, creating a table based on CSV headers.

- **Email Validation:** `validate_email_addresses` function validates email addresses in a specified column of an SQLite table using a regular expression.

- **Query Logging:** `log_query` function logs SQL queries to a 'query_logs' table within the SQLite database.

- **Query Prediction:** `predict_most_repeatable_queries` function analyzes query logs and predicts the most repeatable queries, displaying the top N queries along with execution counts.

- **Boundary Check:** `perform_boundary_check` function performs a boundary check on a specified column in an SQLite table, identifying rows with values outside the specified bounds.

- **Age Validation:** `validate_age_entries` function validates age entries in a specified column of an SQLite table, checking if they meet a specified age threshold.

- **Main Function:** The main function demonstrates the usage of the above functions, connecting to an SQLite database, importing data from a CSV file, performing various validations and analyses, and predicting the most repeatable queries.

## Usage

**Requirements:**
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Required Python modules: re, sqlite3, csv, collections.

**Configuration:**
Update the `database_path`, `csv_file_path`, `table_name`, `column_name`, `min_value`, `max_value`, `age_threshold`, and `sample_query` in the main function according to your requirements.

**Execution:**
Run the script using the command: `python script_name.py`

**Output:**
Follow the console output for information on the connection, data import, validations, and query predictions.
